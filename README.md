#Comparison Sort Algorithms
##All of the algorithms here can be run independently of each other by compiling and running each respective file, or all can be run at once while being timed if Comparison_Sorts.c is compiled and ran.

##Notes
###Heapsort does not compile. 
###Everything can be compiled normally using "make" in your CLI.
###Attached is a PDF of the "time vs unsorted amount" graph.
